# Documentation

## Frontend

The frontend documentation uses a tool called **Storybook (for React)**.

Since project-token can't be taken from the project, code will be uploaded in `/doc/sprint1/documentation/Orchestra` instead of published page.

Steps to execute documentation:

1. Move into `/doc/sprint1/documentation/Orchestra`.
1. On shell, type `yarn` to install dependencies.
1. On shell, type `yarn storybook` to execute the storybook.
1. The documentation page will be available on http://localhost:6006/.
