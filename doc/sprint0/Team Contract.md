### Methods Of Communication

The main method of communication shall be the “CSCC01 Conductor” Discord server. If necessary team members can also be reached using the email or phone number provided in team.md

### Communication Response Times

The expected response time of messages should be no more than 2 days, regardless of communication method. It is expected that team members will do their best to respond to messages and attend meetings, barring extenuating circumstances.

### Running Meetings & Attendance

Meetings will be held on Discord, at a time decided unanimously by group members. Group members should take their own meeting notes, and are encouraged to post materials related to meetings in #resources. It is expected that all members will be in attendance, however if someone misses a meeting, it is their responsibility to reach out and ask for clarification, and the team’s responsibility to help get them up to speed.

### Meeting Preparation

There may be specific meeting topics (e.g. using new technology to solve a problem), in which it may be expected that team members do research before attending the meeting. Research findings can be a simple verbal rundown.

### Version Control

Best practices will be followed when working with the repo; Members should adhere to Git flow as taught in tutorial 1, and make pull requests to merge branches. Similarly, issues on Jira should only be marked done after being reviewed by another team member. 

### Division Of Work

Division of work will be discussed in meetings. It is expected that members will do their best to take on as much work as possible, and keep in mind the task of maximising the rubric mark. The division of work will be reflected in the assignment of user stories on Jira

### Contingency Planning

If a member cannot complete some of their work, they should contact the team ASAP to have their workload redistributed. If a member wants to drop the course, as a courtesy they should first contact the team and help everyone get up to speed on their work so far. It is expected that team members avoid plagiarism at all costs.
