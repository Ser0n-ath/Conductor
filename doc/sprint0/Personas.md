# Persona 1: General Undergrad Student
![[General Undergrad.png]]
Nineteen-year-old Jason is a freshman at the University of Toronto Scarborough. He takes six courses including two electives. He played violin since he was ten, and he was in the high school orchestra for the whole three years. Thus, he applied to the string orchestra and became a string player. Working in an orchestra gave him experience working with a team, and made him aware of the power of collaboration. Jason would appreciate being able to leverage the collaborative power of the bot marketplace to be able to both share his bot designs and use others’. 

Every morning, he practices violin at the studio he used to visit when he was in high school. He practices for an hour and goes to take courses. After the class, Jason goes back home and takes a nap until 4. After the nap, he goes to the library to work on his assignments. Except for Wednesday, since he has orchestra practice at 5. But he lates sometimes, because he sometimes forgets to set the alarm at 4. Jason would appreciate a simple organizational tool to help him stay on top of things like this.

At night, Jason plays “League of Legends” with his friends. He uses discord to talk with his friends while playing the game. Jason has an average knowledge about digital tools, and uses his devices mostly to consume content. Orchestra’s scheduling interface will be designed to flatten the learning curve for this type of user.

Parth Singh is a 20-year-old who is currently in Toronto, Canada for his undergraduate studies at the University of Ontario. He is a second-year computer science student who loves to participate in hackathons and create side projects with colleagues who are in a similar program. He loves to explore the depths of Software Engineering by completing advanced certificate courses on Edx and Coursera. He is comfortable with Javascript, C, Python, and Java. He has excellent communication skills and is a friendly person. Aside from academics, he likes to play Rocket League and Call of Duty with his friends after university during the evening or during the weekends.

Parth found his interest in coding when he started playing with SCRATCH programming and got hooked on what it possibly could do. His high school did not provide computer science as a subject for students, so he decided to learn on his own. He started learning the basic CS50 course on Coursera and from there onward, he started to explore the power of computer science.

Parth is currently a full-time student at the University. He is taking Multivariable-Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Software tools and System programming. In order to not lose the practice of coding due to a math-heavy semester, he has plans on completing at least one leetcode problem every day. He is currently a web developer for the Business Association at the University of Ontario where his main responsibility is to keep the website of the association updated with the executive information and upcoming events.

His goal for this term is to build an email scheduler bot that allows users to send an email at their own specified time. Instead of just uploading the product on GitHub for others to see, he wants a platform that allows developers like him to upload their products where real clients can use them. His plan is to allow real-life clients to use his service and get feedback on features the clients want to see and the product’s efficiency and user-friendly interface review. He feels this feedback and his profile rating can massively help his job search.

Nebuchadnezzar, age 45, is a freelance consultant that wants to automate his workflow. The nature of his work requires him to remain on top of all logistical issues as well as balance responsibilities in his personal life. Managing client communications, paying bills on time, remembering to send important emails; There are many tedious but crucial repetitive tasks he must deal with.
He is driven by being his own boss, and so tries to do everything himself.
Being a solo consultant he must also work long hours to be able to stay on top of everything. With a powerful automated planning tool like Orchestra in his arsenal, he’ll have more free time for himself, and not need to hire outside help and remain independent.
He likes using the newest consumer tech, but does not have the time to teach himself all the tools necessary to automate his workflow. A perk of his career is being able to work while traveling, and so he is away from his desk most days. He would really appreciate being able to interact with Orchestra solely through his phone. Being able to generate summary graphs and reports periodically and review them will also give him insights into how to optimize his business.

Phillip Foden is a 24-year-old Computer Science hobbyist who is currently living in Boston, USA. He spends his free time watching Youtube tutorials and exploring different programming languages and APIs. He loves starting new coding projects to expand his knowledge and participating in hackathons to gauge his abilities. He is a curious individual who loves to learn new things, and is a great self learner. 

Phillip found his interest in coding when he took his first Computer Science class in high school. However, it only scratched the surface of what he wanted to do so he looked on the internet to self learn himself. He started learning the basics in Python and Java before expanding to different programming languages and moving onto more advanced frameworks from there.

Phillip plans to use Orchestra to create several different bots that will help make his every day tasks simpler. He plans to coordinate his IoT devices with Orchestra to create a smart home. He places his bots on the marketplace for the community to use, being rewarded with ratings and interactions. He is specifically keen on helping to automate his alarm clock, emails and notifications. Phillip feels Orchestra can be a rewarding app to design bots on, and is willing to read through the documentation to learn more. He enjoys seeing new ideas from the marketplace that may inspire him for his own side projects in the future. He wants to connect to his fellow peers by sending them a rating on their bot, and seeing how it functions similar to his.
