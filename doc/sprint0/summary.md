## The Project Objective:
To build an item scheduling application centred around a key functionality; To allow users to schedule bots to run automatically given certain initial parameters that inform events. Examples of such events could be alarm based (e.g. Turn off smart lamp at 8:40PM), or based on the activities of other bots (e.g. Run bot B iff Bot A ran first and exited with a specified return code). 

Bots can be created by users (and integrated into our service via an API we provide), or obtained from a community marketplace. Bots will run on the end user’s device, handled by a remote event scheduler. 
  
Key Personas:
-   Nebuchadnezzar, a freelance creative that needs to automate parts of their workflow.  
-   Ayodele Abioye, a YouTuber that wants to automate her upload process
-   Parth Singh, a university student who wants to build an email scheduler bot

We believe a program like this can prove to be a useful tool for organisational and consumer users alike. Organisation users can automate their workflows (e.g. collate and distribute a report on a weekly basis), write custom tools to solve their problems, or find one in the marketplace. Our application is also a powerful organisational tool for consumers, for example automating their IoT devices, running web scrapers, and so on. While many IoT devices have scheduling functionalities, they are usually limited in function and restricted to proprietary apps; Orchestra expands functionality and makes automation accessible to everyone.

We intend to build a simple but powerful UI that makes scheduling bots and setting up conditions as simple as possible; Saving training time for enterprise users, and making this tool more accessible for consumer users. Power users can also benefit from having a scheduling framework ready to go, and can instead focus on building simple programs; We handle the “when”, they only worry about “how”. These power users will also be the key to the marketplace, as they will be the ones uploading their bots.   

Our key principle is accessibility over feature density, and market quality over market quantity. We want the marketplace to be a place where quality tools are available, and can be created by everyone, and we will deliver this using our API.
