# Process

## Team Organization:
-   First we identified what needed to be completed for sprint 0 and determined that the work would most effectively get completed via Google Drive and Docs, since all deliverables were text based documents
-   Instead of utilizing a version control system, a blank document for each deliverable was created and its requirements were added to its contents, in addition to a document that indexed all deliverables
-   Group members took the opportunity to add their names beside which deliverables they felt comfortable working on, effectively providing each deliverable with at least 1 caretaker
-   Since all deliverable documents were available to all members, members freely added notes wherever they saw fit, possibly after a discussion in the team’s chat on Discord
-   There was a shared Google Drive folder for collaborating on all deliverables

## Decision Process:
-   Since everyone in the team is active in the team’s chat on Discord, important decisions were posted in the chat’s main channel, and any objections were discussed there and then in the chat, allowing the strongest arguments to take priority, and repeating until no objections are left
-   In the case of pivotal decisions which would have much work follow after them, Xoyondo was used to host anonymous polls to settle for these group decisions

## User Story Points:
-   An identical approach was taken for defining user story points, as was for the previously mentioned decision process. We used an informal Kano Model approach.
-   The approach allowed for open commentary that was assessed by the entire team in the chat, which served beneficial since everyone had a solid understanding of the overall idea of the project, via discourse over the tools and frameworks planned to be used, along with how they would be used to build the application from the ground up, making some features inevitably necessary and others debatable
-   Votes usually came in the form of agreements and objections in the chat, meaning as long as the active users all agreed, and no objections were raised by any other members, a decision was settled immediately, unless a later objection brought up a critical flaw in the decision made

## Meetings:
-   Meetings were held frequently, over Discord (approx. every 2 to 3 days)
-   Members suggested meetings as they saw fit, depending on remaining workload

## Lessons:
-   Members should stick to conventions like shared documents, in order to avoid duplicating effort and so everyone is on the same page.
-   Shared documentation allows for work to be quicker than utilizing a version control system like Git
